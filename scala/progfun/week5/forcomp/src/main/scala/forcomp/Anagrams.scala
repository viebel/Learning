  /** Returns a list of all anagram sentences of the given sentence.
   *  
   *  An anagram of a sentence is formed by taking the occurrences of all the characters of
   *  all the words in the sentence, and producing all possible combinations of words with those characters,
   *  such that the words have to be from the dictionary.
   *
   *  The number of words in the sentence and its anagrams does not have to correspond.
   *  For example, the sentence `List("I", "love", "you")` is an anagram of the sentence `List("You", "olive")`.
   *
   *  Also, two sentences with the same words but in a different order are considered two different anagrams.
   *  For example, sentences `List("You", "olive")` and `List("olive", "you")` are different anagrams of
   *  `List("I", "love", "you")`.
   *  
   *  Here is a full example of a sentence `List("Yes", "man")` and its anagrams for our dictionary:
   *
   *    List(
   *      List(en, as, my),
   *      List(en, my, as),
   *      List(man, yes),
   *      List(men, say),
   *      List(as, en, my),
   *      List(as, my, en),
   *      List(sane, my),
   *      List(Sean, my),
   *      List(my, en, as),
   *      List(my, as, en),
   *      List(my, sane),
   *      List(my, Sean),
   *      List(say, men),
   *      List(yes, man)
   *    )
   *
   *  The different sentences do not have to be output in the order shown above - any order is fine as long as
   *  all the anagrams are there. Every returned word has to exist in the dictionary.
   *  
   *  Note: in case that the words of the sentence are in the dictionary, then the sentence is the anagram of itself,
   *  so it has to be returned in this list.
   *
   *  Note: There is only one anagram of an empty sentence.
